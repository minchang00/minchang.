# Onboarding Application Pipeline

## Overview
This is an onboarding user-guide for the pipeline, explaining the step-by-step process of setting up a pipeline that will help deliver applications such as, OCIO's enterprise GitHub organizations (bcgov and bcgov-c), NR Broker, and CI/CD to production. 

### Prerequisites
- Team name
  - All team members need to first access NR Broker UI to get member IDIR available.    
**<sub> This step is important as it gives team members access to services that are required to run the systems properly.</sub>**
  - At least add one owner to manage all team members
  - Make sure the Team name is unique, can't have duplicates
- Project Name
- Service Name
- Tools Secret (eg. secrets for Broker Token & Jenkins Tokens)
- Software or Framework Name (eg. Java, Nodejs, etc)
- GitHub Repository for application
  - All the the details mentioned above should be included

**After completing the prerequisite, please inform your PO to inform the OSCAR Team about the completed set-up.**
